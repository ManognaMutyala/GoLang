go run compiles and runs application but doesn't build an executable file
go build compiles and builds executable file which can be run later

if we want to build an executable file called automation.exe from main.go then we can use the below command
go build -o automation.exe

Running go build on current directory will compile all current directory and creates executable files with the name of the directory
